![GS_Release_2025-07-05_Image_1.png](./images/GS_Release_2025-07-05_Image_1.png)

Release Date: 2024-10-17

## Summary

The GenericSuite team continues to innovate with its latest release on October 17, 2024. This version introduces exciting new features that will improve how developers work with AI.

One of the main highlights is the implementation of a preamble model to run OpenAI o1-mini/o1-preview models with tools and system messages. This provides greater flexibility when working with these models. Additionally, new configurations have been added to customize the preamble model, allowing users to tailor its behavior to their specific needs.

The update also introduces Ollama server integration, opening up new possibilities for managing models like Ollama "llava," which do not accept tools messages. Now, models can be configured to function optimally in these scenarios.

Finally, a key issue has been addressed where agents were returning empty responses in LCEL chains. Agents will now return results correctly when there are no more tools to call.

Donâ€™t miss out on this update, which takes AI management to the next level!
